This folder is called the find series because I plan to make more than just one. If you have suggestions email at ethienduckett@outlook.com
I am not to be held liable for you misusing my software and my software breaking your computer. Always make a backup and test on a VM if you can.
I recommend you always read the read me because I will list what my "installer" does. It in theory creates a symlink of downimg.sh and puts it in the bin folder.
also DO NOT MOVE THE FILES if you take the files out of the folder they will break.
