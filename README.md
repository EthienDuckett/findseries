# findseries
For extracting media from websites
Not complete also send me bugs at ethienduckett@outlook.com
Note that every part in the find series will have an installer, to run that installer go to the part you want like findimg and type 'bash installer.sh'. This will put a symlink into your /usr/bin file hopefully.
